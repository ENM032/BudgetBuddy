## GitHub Actions
We implemented GitHub Actions using a YAML configuration in `.github/workflows` This config is activated each time we push to the `main` branch.
These are the main steps in our workflow:

Environment Setup: The workflow begins by checking out the repository and setting environment variables for the current date and repository name.
JDK Setup: Configures Java 17 using the Zulu distribution, which is cached to speed up any future runs.
Gradle Build and Tests: Runs unit tests, assembles both debug and release APKs, and generates an AAB for the release, ensuring each build is reliable and ready for distribution.
Artifact Uploads: Each generated APK and AAB is uploaded as an artifact, labeled by date and repository, allowing easy access for further testing or deployment.

## Comprehensive Report
As a team, we used GitHub for collaborative development, creating a shared repository to host the source code. Through branching, members could work on different features or bug fixes simultaneously without interference. GitHub Actions were used to automate tests and deployments, improving the development cycle's efficiency. This approach helped maintain version control, enhanced team coordination, and delivered a well-organized, high-quality application.
